          <h2>Exploring Dublin: A City of History and Culture</h2>

          <p>I got to Dublin bright and early, hopping on the Dublin Express straight to the hotel after getting off at
            Ushers Quay. The walk to the hotel was a bit of a struggle, mostly uphill. After dropping off my stuff in my
            room, I joined the class for a walk down to the classroom. Along the way, we checked out Francis Street,
            with all its cool charity and antique shops. I couldn't wait to dive into the local coffee and food scene!
          </p>

          <p>At <a tabindex="-1" href="https://www.griffith.ie/">Griffith College</a>, we had a quick orientation
            session, where they gave us the lowdown on local lingo—I was torn between sounding authentic and feeling a
            bit silly. Then a bunch of us hit up <a href="https://thefumbally.ie/">Fumbally</a>’s for some grub, which
            hit the spot and had a great vibe.</p>

          <p>The bus tour was amazing, even though I was battling some light jet lag. The countryside was stunningly
            green, but there were also some heavy topics discussed, like the country's history of conflict.</p>

          <h2>First Day of Class & First Day of Exploration</h2>

          <p>Today was the first class, all about getting started on our website project, mainly focusing on style.
            After class, a few of us strolled down Grafton Street in search of food. Along the way, we popped into a
            tiny hardware store for some adapters. It was one of those places crammed with everything you could imagine.
            The guy behind the counter was friendly, asking us where we were from and what brought us to town.</p>

          <p>After our detour, we landed at a restaurant where I indulged in the most amazing Pad Thai. With class done
            and my stomach satisfied, I felt a bit weary and ended up taking a nap.</p>

          <p>Upon waking, I made my way to <a href="https://www.stpatrickscathedral.ie/">St. Patrick's Cathedral</a>. It
            was awe-inspiring, with so much to take in. I grabbed an audio guide, which led me through the stories
            behind the cathedral's treasures. Even the floor tiles caught my attention. There was a section where you
            could interact, touching the stained glass and stone slabs. As luck would have it, there was a service
            nearing its start, and I decided to stick around. The choir's rehearsal filled the space with such beautiful
            choral music that I couldn't tear myself away.</p>

          <h2>Dr. David Williams & Light Exploring Day</h2>

          <p>
            On May 9th, I took a breather from the hustle and bustle of travel, embracing the day as a blend of study
            and self-care. Despite the weariness, the sun cast its warm glow, and the locals' infectious cheer reminded
            us of the privilege of such splendid weather. I couldn't help but feel grateful for the Vitamin D boost and
            a solid cup of coffee, the perfect antidote to travel fatigue.

            Come evening, <a href="https://www.leoburdock.com/">Leo Burdock</a> beckoned for dinner pickup, a
            recommendation from our trusty tour guide. Now, full disclosure – fish isn't exactly my go-to, but hey,
            variety is the spice of life, right? The fries however were good. And the stroll there was picture-perfect,
            with the sunset painting the sky.</p>

          <h2>Sunshine, History, and Interactive Museums</h2>

          <p>
            May 10th gifted us with yet another sun-kissed day, prompting us to take our blog site testing outdoors –
            because, you know, accessibility matters, even under the sun. Our afternoon rendezvous led us to the <a
              href="https://epicchq.com/">EPIC museum</a>, and let me tell you, it truly lived up to its name. EPIC,
            which stands for "cultural, political, and economic development," delved deep into the tapestry of Irish
            emigration and its global impact.
          <p>
            It was a museum experience that was more than just a stroll through history. At EPIC, history comes alive
            through interactive exhibits – think swiping through video galleries, putting your brain to the test with
            motion sensor quizzes, and even busting a move in the footsteps of legends (Irish dancing that we laughed
            trying to accomplish). It's not just about dates and names; it's about experiencing Irish culture firsthand.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the entrance, you're handed a paper passport, your ticket to navigate through the museum's labyrinth of
            stories. Each room has a stamper to mark your journey, a whimsical touch that adds a personal flair to the
            experience. Plus, the museum's housed in the historic CHQ building, a nod to its roots as a tobacco store
            dating back to the 19th century.
          </p>

          <p>
            My personal highlight? The library room, adorned with works by Irish authors, some of which seemed to glow
            with literary brilliance. Above is a picture of me pulling a book from the shelf(Gone with the Wind),
            tilting it out, and being greeted with an excerpt being read aloud. Wow, I love museum design!

          </p>

          <p>
            After soaking up all that history, it was time to refuel. A few of us ventured out for food and drinks,
            continuing our exploration of Dublin's vibrant nightlife.

          <h2>Exploring Ireland's Heritage: From Ancient Monasteries to Castle Courtyards</h2>

          <p>
            May 11th was a visual feast, with lush greens that seemed too perfect to be real. Our day trip to <a
              href="https://glendalough.ie/">Glendalough</a> and Kilkenny unveiled stunning sights, especially the
            monastery where nature intertwined with ancient stone buildings, creating a mesmerizing scene.

          <p>
            The headstones at Glendalough were like history textbooks in stone, revealing detailed accounts of lives
            long past, including causes of death – a stark difference from what we're accustomed to back home. But it's
            fascinating to see how people communicated before the internet era.
          </p>
          <p>
            The walk to the lake was enjoyable, and our unexpected sunny weather seemed to catch the locals off guard –
            but not our group, we were getting accustomed to sunny Ireland. Once at the Lake, Professor Colleen urged us
            to step into the waters. I hesitated initially, but eventually I went in because I thought I would regret it
            if I didn’t. The water was cold but it was worth it. </p>

          <p>
            Next, it was off to Kilkenny, where I treated myself to some ice cream before exploring the decorative halls
            of <a href="https://kilkennycastle.ie/">Kilkenny Castle</a>. Every room was extravagant, with even the
            stairwells boasting intricately carved stone walls. <a href="/kilkenny.html">See my full page on this
              day.</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            But what truly warmed my heart was seeing locals relaxing on the grass around the castle, enjoying picnics
            and games – a reminder that these historic sites are cherished by the community. As we returned home,
            exhaustion hit me, and I collapsed into bed.

          <h2>Happy Mothers Dayyyy!</h2>
          Independant trip day!! A small group of us decided to go on a bus trip up to Belfast
          <ul>
            <li>We hopped on the bus at 7am which for all of us was early.</li>
            <li>We went on a black cab tour and learned of the divide of Northern Ireland, one of which we had no idea about. I think I said “wait there is a literal wall” maybe about a dozen times.</li>
            <li>After the tour we took a walk on one of the docks in the Belfast Port and saw where the Titanic would have left from.</li>
            <li>The next stop on our bus trip was to Dunluce Castle which was really cool and well preserved, and the views were wonderful as well! I think it is so fun to think about what the people living there would look out on every day: the ocean crashing into the cliffs.</li>
            <li>Then the highlight of our trip was Giant's Causeway. The basalt columns were unreal. We took the red trail down which featured steep stairs and maybe a mile or two. But it was perfect for taking in the view.</li>
            <li>Then before we got on the long bus ride back I had the most tasty Irish stew.</li>

          <h2>Microsoft!!!</h2>

          <p>After class, I got a great veggie sandwich from the Fumbally and went home to change for our visit to Microsoft. I took the tram there nice and early just in case, so I had some extra time to sit in the warm sun. Eventually we all made it to the tour. The tour was interesting and it was nice to see what such a large corporate space looks like. I am still unsure if a place like that would suit me, but it is interesting none the less.</p>

          <p>
            On our way back to StayCity, the tram lost all power and was shut down. This was right during rush hour traffic so we were all feeling a bit stressed. We got a taxi home after waiting for one for almost 30 minutes and we all got some food at John's Bar and Haberdashery. By this point, we were all hangry so we all got the student meal deal. I got the cheese burger with garlic fries which was so so good. We all took a bit of a rest and then went back to Street 66. It was game night there, so we all played some cards. This got competitive really quick, and Sam ended the game as our loser.

          <h2>Docklands</h2>

          <p>After class on Thursday, I got a sandwich from the Soren & Son. It was yummy. Then it was time for the walking tour with Dr. Darren Kelly. It was quite interesting to learn about how Dublin became the tech hub of Europe, and how each step in that process related to different points in Dublin's recent history.</p>

          <p>
            After that I was feeling a bit tired and decided to take myself on a little solo date to Salamanca. I got the strawberry basil sangria and churros. They were delicious and I enjoyed people watching.

          <h2>Cliffs of Moher (oooo… ahhhhh)</h2>

          <p>We started with an early morning walk, the perfect way to soak in the fresh air and the peacefulness of the
            countryside. It was so serene and quiet, a great way to begin the day.</p>

          <p>On our way to the bus stop, we made a quick stop at a castle. It wasn't a planned visit, but stumbling upon
            these historical gems is one of the perks of living in Ireland. Even a brief stop to marvel at its ancient
            walls was enough to spark our imagination.
          </p>

          <p>Then, we hopped on a bus to the <a href="https://www.cliffsofmoher.ie/">Cliffs of Moher</a>. The ride
            itself was picturesque, with rolling green hills and quaint little villages along the way. When we finally
            arrived, the sight of the cliffs was absolutely breathtaking. We spent hours hiking both sides, taking in
            the stunning views of the rugged cliffs meeting the Atlantic Ocean. Along the way, we even saw some cows
            grazing peacefully, a charming reminder of Ireland's beauty.
          </p>

          <p>I had lunch at the restaurant towards the bottom of the Cliffs entrance.I grabbed a sandwich which, in my
            ravenous state, tasted absolutely fantastic. Maybe it was genuinely great, or maybe I was just that hungry,
            but either way, it hit the spot.
          </p>

          <p>After exploring all day, we took the bus back home. Exhausted but happy, we picked up burgers for dinner,
            then crashed as soon as we got back to our place.
          </p>

          <h2>Dublin Exploring Day: From Coffee straight to Guinness</h2>
      
          <p>The day had started on a delicious note. On our way to Trinity College we stopped in Two Pups for coffee
            and I got a cinnamon bun (warmed up obviously). The Trinity College tour was led by a CEA CAPPA staff
            member, Margot, who went to Trinity so she had accurate and interesting insight into the school. A highlight
            was definitely her favorite building: <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Building_(Trinity_College_Dublin)">Museum Building (Geology,
              Geography and Civil Engineering). </a>
          </p>
      
          <p>After Trinity College, I indulged my inner culture vulture with some museum hopping. Dublin is rich with
            museums, and I decided to check out the National Museum of Ireland - Archeology and Natural History. The
            exhibits spanned everything from ancient treasures to modern artifacts. Each room was like stepping into a
            different era. The Natural History Museum or the “dead zoo” as some call it was a bit disturbing but
            interesting nonetheless.
          </p>
      
          <p>In the afternoon, it was time for one of Dublin's most iconic experiences - the <a
              href="https://www.guinness-storehouse.com/en/home">Guinness Storehouse.</a> Even if you're not a beer
            aficionado, this place was fascinating. The interactive tour took me through the brewing process, the
            history of Guinness, and, of course, ended with a pint in the Gravity Bar. I even got to learn how to pour
            my own pint of Guinness and am not certified "to pour a beautiful pint of Guinness." Not sure how official
            that is but I feel good about it either way. The panoramic view of Dublin from the Gravity Bar was
            absolutely stunning!
          </p>
      
          <p>To wrap up this amazing day, a group of us headed to Masa for some much-needed tacos. It was the perfect
            way to unwind and reflect on a day well spent. We ended the night with a few drinks.

          <h2>Irish Dancing, Dancing & Drinking</h2>
        
          <p>
            We laughed, we cried, we sweat… we showered. It was an eventful day. Today I did a big push on my website and did my
            best to stay focused in class. After class a few of us went to the Fumbally to get some more work done as we only had
            2 days of class left.          
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Prior to our Irish dance lesson we went to the whiskey museum for a tour and tasting. I have come to the conclusion
            that I might not like whiskey that much… but I could. Then we walked so fast back to Griffith college for dancing
            (this was the laughing part). We put our whole heart into it. But it was warm and kinda sweaty which was not ideal.
            After I went home and showered because ew sweat.          
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I got ready to go out and we went to The George and danced for a few hours, then we moved to Drury Street in search of
            a bar. We ended up experiencing Liverpool fans who were chanting in a bar. It was a fun night, probably the best night
            for me in Dublin so far!
