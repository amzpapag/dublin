        <h3>Exploring Dublin: A City of History and Culture</h3>

        <p>I got to Dublin bright and early, hopping on the Dublin Express straight to the hotel after getting off at Ushers Quay. The walk to the hotel was a bit of a struggle, mostly uphill. After dropping off my stuff in my room, I joined the class for a walk down to the classroom. Along the way, we checked out Francis Street, with all its cool charity and antique shops. I couldn't wait to dive into the local coffee and food scene!</p>
        
        <p>At Griffith College, we had a quick orientation session, where they gave us the lowdown on local lingo—I was torn between sounding authentic and feeling a bit silly. Then a bunch of us hit up Fumbally’s for some grub, which hit the spot and had a great vibe.</p> 
          
        <p>The bus tour was amazing, even though I was battling some light jet lag. The countryside was stunningly green, but there were also some heavy topics discussed, like the country's history of conflict.</p>

        <h3>First Day of Class & First Day of Exploration</h3>

        <p>Today was the first class, all about getting started on our website project, mainly focusing on style. After class, a few of us strolled down Grafton Street in search of food. Along the way, we popped into a tiny hardware store for some adapters. It was one of those places crammed with everything you could imagine. The guy behind the counter was friendly, asking us where we were from and what brought us to town.</p>
        
        <p>After our detour, we landed at a restaurant where I indulged in the most amazing Pad Thai. With class done and my stomach satisfied, I felt a bit weary and ended up taking a nap.</p> 
          
        <p>Upon waking, I made my way to St. Patrick's Cathedral. It was awe-inspiring, with so much to take in. I grabbed an audio guide, which led me through the stories behind the cathedral's treasures. Even the floor tiles caught my attention. There was a section where you could interact, touching the stained glass and stone slabs. As luck would have it, there was a service nearing its start, and I decided to stick around. The choir's rehearsal filled the space with such beautiful choral music that I couldn't tear myself away.</p>
