                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde_Memorial_Sculpture">The Oscar Wilde Memorial
                        Sculpture</a> in Dublin's Merrion Square consists of three statues created by sculptor Danny
                    Osborne and unveiled in 1997. The main statue depicts Wilde reclining on a quartz boulder, crafted
                    from stones sourced globally. Flanking the main statue are pillars adorned with bronze and granite
                    sculptures representing Wilde's wife and the Greek god Dionysus, along with inscriptions of Wilde's
                    poetry.

                    The delayed recognition of Wilde in his native city reflects historical conservatism towards his
                    sexuality. The sculpture's design, including Wilde's facial expression and posture, symbolizes his
                    dual nature as a witty icon and a man broken by societal condemnation. The monument's placement
                    invites viewers to contemplate different aspects of Wilde's identity and legacy, sparking
                    discussions about his sexuality and cultural significance.

                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Mellows">Liam Mellows</a> was an Irish republican
                        and Sinn Féin politician born in England in 1892. Raised in Ireland, he became active in
                        nationalist movements from an early age, joining the Irish Republican Brotherhood and Irish
                        Volunteers. He played significant roles in the Easter Rising of 1916 and the subsequent War of
                        Independence. Elected to the First Dáil, he opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and was a prominent
                        figure in the anti-Treaty faction during the Irish Civil War. Mellows was captured by pro-Treaty
                        forces and executed in December 1922. He advocated for socialist principles, promoting state
                        ownership of industries, land redistribution, and workers' rights. Mellows is commemorated with
                        statues, barracks names, and street names across Ireland, reflecting his enduring influence on
                        Irish Republicanism and socialist thought.

Born in Dublin in 1828, he held various positions within the church, including Dean of Christ Church Cathedral and Bishop of Meath, before eventually becoming Archbishop of Dublin in 1884.
                            
                            Plunket was known for his contributions to education and his advocacy for the reformed faith in various countries. He married Anne Lee Guinness in 1863, and they had children, including William, who pursued a successful career in government administration, and Benjamin, who also served as a bishop. Plunket passed away in 1897 and was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery in Dublin. His statue near Leinster House in Kildare Street, Dublin, serves as a landmark commemorating his life and contributions.
